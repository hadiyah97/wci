# bắt đầu

##### Problem Statement
Most programming languages tend to use English keywords such as `for`, `while`, `if` etc. As a result, non-English speakers have to memorize the keywords when learning to code, and miss out on the intuition that is available to English speakers. This project was created with the goal of increasing accessibility to learning programming, one language at a time.

So far, an interpreter and compiler for a procedural language written using Vietnamese keywords has been written and tested. To complete the project, the [ANTLR4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) parser generator was used as the framework.

The project was named *bắt đầu* after the Vietnamese word for *begin*.

##### Code Guide
The code in each folder prefixed with 'Assignment-' incrementally creates a compiler for the Pascal language, implemented in C++.
The code in this repo builds on top of the code owned and written by Prof. Ron Mak at San Jose State University.
See http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~mak/CMPE152/index.html for more details.
(This Pascal compiler was used as the reference for creating the Vietnamese compiler.)

Folders with the prefix 'vietnamese-' contain code that incrementally builds a compiler for a new programming language designed for Vietnamese-speaking people. It is a procedural language similar to Pascal.
